# NoSQL

What are NoSQL database management systems and how do they differ from relational database management systems? What is MongoDB database management system and how can it be used to store and manage data? How can MongoDB be used with the Python programming language to implement a database application? The purpose of this course is answer these and many other questions related to NoSQL database management systems.

During this course we will learn the principles of NoSQL database management systems, how they differ from relational database management systems, what are their benefits and challenges, and practical applications. The course covers in more detail the principles of a widely adopted MongoDB database management system and how to use it in database application development with the Python programming language.

The scope of the course is 2 credits. The prerequisites for the course are the [Data Management and Databases](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SOF001AS2AE) (SOF001AS2AE) and [Python Programming](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SOF001AS2AE) (SOF004AS2AE) courses or similar knowledge and skills. The course has no lessons, instead the course is completed by studying the material and completing the compulsory exercises independently. On top of the exercises, the acquired knowledge and skills are applied in practice by developing a simple programming project with Python.

The course is assesment is either approved or rejected. An approved completion of the course requires completing the exercises and implementing a project of an appropriate scope of complexity. The four sections of the course describe the requirements of completing the section in more detail. You can complete the course at your own pace and request the credits once the requirements are met.
