# Introduction to NoSQL database management systems

> _"When people use the term "NoSQL database", they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term "NoSQL" stands for "non-SQL" while others say it stands for "not only SQL". Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases store data in a more natural and flexible way.
